<indent/> Hi! My name is Sam, and I'm a programmer, musician and digital artist
from Montreal, Qc. Initially interested in visual arts and music, I've
studied classical music at McGill university, and eventually sought
to integrate my practices by taking on programming and following the
Computation Arts degree at Concordia University.
<br><br>
<indent/>
I've gained experience
with all sorts of software and languages, such as html5, javascript, Unity/C#,
Max/Msp, Ableton, Cubase, iZotope, Blender, Arduino, Vyv Photon and Mad Mapper.
I currently work as both teaching assistant and research assistant at Concordia
and seek to pursue my career as generalist programmer and audio specialist
in the video game industry.
