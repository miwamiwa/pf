  <br><br>
  <indent/> Hi! My name is Sam, and I'm a programmer, musician and digital artist
  from Montreal, Qc. Initially interested in visual arts and music, I've
  studied classical music at McGill university, and eventually sought
  to integrate my practices by taking on programming and following the
  Computation Arts degree at Concordia University.
  <br><br>
  <indent/>
  I've gained experience
  with all sorts of software and languages, such as html5, javascript, Unity/C#,
  Max/Msp, Ableton, Cubase, iZotope, Blender, Arduino, Vyv Photon and Mad Mapper.
  I currently work as both teaching assistant and research assistant at Concordia
  and seek to pursue my career as generalist programmer and audio specialist
  in the video game industry.

  <br><br>I am:<br>
  <br><indent/>- a creative programmer fluent in Unity and html5 development
  <br><indent/>- a composer and sound designer with a passion for video games
  <br><indent/>- a multimedia artist comfortable learning new software and languages
  <br><indent/>- a good communicator and team player
  <br><indent/>- an aspiring game designer
