      body:`
      %#Scenes from the epic of Gilgamesh told in vignette game form.

      %#%#These are two short works constitute exercises in story telling
      through game, visual and sound design.

      %#%#In the first vignette, the player takes the role of a god invoked by the
      city councillors of Uruk to guide Gilgamesh in his travels. With simply click-and-drag
      motions, they swipe mountains aside, draw a road in the ground, and wash
      up Gilgamesh upon his arrival. The graphic elements (sketched by me and reworked by Melissa Lim)
      and sonic elements hopefully reinforce the tactile feel of each action,
      emphasizing the characters' belief in the gods' agency on the nature that surrounds them.
      %#%# %#a0 %#
      %#%#In the second vignette, the player is Gilgamesh struggling with his impossible
      goal of crossing an ocean no man has ever crossed before, on a broken boat,
      using nothing but poles for propulsion, and eventually, out of sheer desparation,
      using his shirt as a sail. In the original story, Gilgamesh is stopped by multiple
      charaters along the way who question his motives. I chose to make a more introspective
      scene, where Gilgamesh has with himself the conversation which he has with his
      detractors in the original story: he is mourning his dear friend, and must
      carry on with this impossible journey in order to fight off his own death. The
      empty ocean expanse, the frantic button-pressing required to move forward,
      and the contrasting character of the navigator calmly providing the user with
      instructions combine to depict Gilgamesh's mindset in this passage: anguished
      yet heroically moving forward.
      %#%# %#a1 %#

      %#%#Regarding sound design, in both vignettes I explored the use of granulation
      to create different sound textures. The soundtrack of the first vignette is meant
      to set the clock back a few thousand years, while in the second vignette the
      music is more affective, creeping in during the action with an uplifting
      yet melancholic sound that confirms the emotion in the scene.

  featuredIn:["Game Design"],
  featureDescription:{

      body:`
      %#This was an exercise in making a game with Bitsy, a simple editor for making
      narrative games. The idea was to have the player enter a seemingly ordinary
      hub (the laundromat) with an ordinary task, then lead them to staged encounters
      in previously hidden corners of the hub. Each encounter complicates the player's
      situation in some unexpected manner, and also pulls them away from their
      initial (very ordinary) quest, into a fantasy world with gradually less rules.

      %#%#Synopsis:
      %#The player is tasked by their mom to do their own laundry. A shady figure in
      the laundromat steals their change before they even find a free washer. Peaking
      in between the machines for lost change, they meet a pair of mice that ask for
      the laundromat owner's cheese sandwich in exchange for a coin they found. The
      player's bad deed is rewarded with equally bad payment: 25 cents and "advice"
      pointing to a specific dryer. Upon entering the dryer the player becomes tiny,
      and runs into a furious and giant owner who punishes them by tasking
      them to sweep a tiny broom. The player meets a dust-loving bug who eventually leads
      them to more bugs (roaches!) who are super nice, give away all the necessary
      loose change, and even invite the player to their raves. The player becomes
      big again by entering the owner's magic socks, and can finally start their
      laundry cycle.

      %#%#I picked and produced sound effects, composed BGM tracks, set up the project

      The soundtrack featured midi
      instruments that would interchange during gameplay, using tools included
      in Wwise and some C# scripting on the Unity side.

      %# %#a2 %#%#

      %# %#a3 %#%#

      And this sound for a big bad plant-beast (think little shop of horrors!)
      that ended up being removed from the game. One day, plant-beast.
