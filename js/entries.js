Smack sense into them with your stick, and re-forest your way to the checkpoints to clear each level."

  +"<br><br>In this dual VR and non-VR experience, two players compete by catching as many fish as they can on a touch screen while a third player, wearing the VR set, witnesses directly the ecological damage of the first two players' fishing, as they swim across the increasingly dangerous underwater environment that lies beneath."
  +"<br>I created sound effects and edited provided musical material to create different soundtracks for the underwater environment (for the VR user's headphones) and overwater (speakers heard by everyone).<br> I programmed the soundtrack in Max MSP (communicating with the Unity project using OSC), to route the soundtracks easily and to allow for some sound design experimentation. The final result featured use of granulation to handle large amounts of sound emitting objects, and some basic motion mapping.",

<br><br>I picked and produced sound effects, composed BGM tracks, set up the project in Wwise and scripted audio triggers in C#. The soundtrack featured midi instruments that would interchange during gameplay, using tools included in Wwise and some C# scripting on the Unity side.
